            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had been interested in learning how to knit for a few years, but never took 
                    the plunge. One day, I starting looking up Youtube videos of beginner knitting 
                    guides and found a good one for knitting a scarf. I ordered the yarn and the 
                    needles and got to work.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first, it was <em>really</em> frustrating. My first few rows looked nothing like the 
                    scarf in the video, so I had to keep pulling back my work and starting over. 
                    I was about to give up and admit that knitting was not for me, when I 
                    looked down at my work and actually saw the pattern emerging. For the first time 
                    it didn't look terrible!</p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was so excited when I finished my scarf, I could barely wait to jump into another 
                    project. I had so many ideas for things to make; hats, gloves, socks, more scarves. 
                    Since then, I've finished several projects which have improved my skills greatly.</p>
