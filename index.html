                        <li>It's therapeutic. Sometimes you just need to zone out and focus on something 
                            that makes you happy and calm. It's like a form of meditation to me.</li>
                        <li>It's so satisfying to finish a project. There's nothing better than getting 
                            to the end of a project and knowing you put hours into craeting it.</li>
                        <li>I can give my projects to people as gifts. I have a hard time coming up with 
                            gifts for people because just buying something seems not very personal. But 
                            something I spent hours making always seems like a more meaningful gift to me.</li>

                    <h2>How I learned to knit:</h2>
                </header>  
                <div class="info">
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I had been interested in learning how to knit for a few years, but never took 
                        the plunge. One day, I starting looking up Youtube videos of beginner knitting 
                        guides and found a good one for knitting a scarf. I ordered the yarn and the 
                        needles and got to work.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At first, it was <em>really</em> frustrating. My first few rows looked nothing like the 
                        scarf in the video, so I had to keep pulling back my work and starting over. 
                        I was about to give up and admit that knitting was not for me, when I 
                        looked down at my work and actually saw the pattern emerging. For the first time 
                        it didn't look terrible!</p>
                    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I was so excited when I finished my scarf, I could barely wait to jump into another 
                        project. I had so many ideas for things to make; hats, gloves, socks, more scarves. 
                        Since then, I've finished several projects which have improved my skills greatly.</p>

                    <h2>Benefits of knitting:</h2>
                </header>    
                    <ol class="info">
                        <li>You can make all of your own winter garments. You won't have to spend money on 
                            scarves, gloves, sweaters, etc. You'll still have to buy the yarn, but that's 
                            usually cheaper than buying a pre-made garment, unless you're buying really high 
                            quality yarn. It will take you some time to knit the garment, but you'll get 
                            faster as you make more items. It's also <em>way</em> more satisfying to wear a handmade 
                            item.</li>
                        <li>You have something to do when you're watching TV or listening to a podcast. Watching 
                            TV won't seem like as much of a waste of time if you're knitting something in the 
                            process. </li>
                        <li>You always have a unique gift to give someone. Who doesn't love getting and giving 
                            a unique gift?</li>
                        <li>Apparently it can help lower blood presure and prevent cognitive decline. I don't know how, 
                            but I'll take it.</li>
                        <li>You never have to be bored. If you've got nothing going on, just whip out your yarn 
                            and needles and get to work.</li>
                        <li>You can even sell some of your work for a side income. Sometimes you get tired of making 
                            stuff for yourself, so why not sell it? You can put whatever you earn into savings or use 
                            it to buy something special.</li>
