                <li>You can make all of your own winter garments. You won't have to spend money on 
                        scarves, gloves, sweaters, etc. You'll still have to buy the yarn, but that's 
                        usually cheaper than buying a pre-made garment, unless you're buying really high 
                        quality yarn. It will take you some time to knit the garment, but you'll get 
                        faster as you make more items. It's also <em>way</em> more satisfying to wear a handmade 
                        item.</li>
                <li>You have something to do when you're watching TV or listening to a podcast. Watching 
                        TV won't seem like as much of a waste of time if you're knitting something in the 
                        process. </li>
                <li>You always have a unique gift to give someone. Who doesn't love getting and giving 
                        a unique gift?</li>
                <li>Apparently it can help lower blood presure and prevent cognitive decline. I don't know how, 
                        but I'll take it.</li>
                <li>You never have to be bored. If you've got nothing going on, just whip out your yarn 
                        and needles and get to work.</li>
                <li>You can even sell some of your work for a side income. Sometimes you get tired of making 
                        stuff for yourself, so why not sell it? You can put whatever you earn into savings or use 
                        it to buy something special.</li>
